      <h3>How and when to pay</h3>

      <p>To pay the tax charge you must fill in a Self Assessment tax return each tax year. Follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="<%= internal_url "/register-for-self-assessment" %>">Register for Self Assessment</a> if you don’t already fill in a tax return - you should do this by <%= sa_register_deadline %>.
        There are <a href="<%= internal_url "/self-assessment-tax-return-deadlines" %>">deadlines</a> for sending the return. If you’ve not sent one before, you should also register for Self Assessment by <%= sa_register_deadline %>.</li>
        <li>Fill in the tax return and confirm the amount of Child Benefit received for the tax year.</li>
        <li>Send the tax return.</li>
        <li>Pay the tax you owe.</li>
        <li>There are <a href="<%= internal_url "/self-assessment-tax-return-deadlines" %>">deadlines</a> for sending the tax return and paying the tax. The person with the highest income pays the tax charge, so use your partner’s income in the calculator if it’s higher than yours.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Your Child Benefit</h3>
      <p>You can choose to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="<%= internal_url "/child-benefit-tax-charge/stop-child-benefit" %>">stop getting Child Benefit</a> - you must pay any tax you owe</li>
        <li>carry on getting Child Benefit - for each tax year you get it you must fill in a tax return and pay any tax you owe</li>
      </ul>

      <% if @calculator.tax_year == 2012 -%>
        <p>Your result for the next tax year may be higher because the tax charge will apply to the whole tax year (and not just 7 January to 5 April 2013).</p>
