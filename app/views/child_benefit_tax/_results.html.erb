    <h2>How and when to pay</h2>

    <p>The tax must be paid by <%= tax_payment_deadline %>.</p>
    <p>To pay the tax you must send a tax return.</p>
    <p>There are <a href="/self-assessment-tax-return-deadlines">deadlines</a> for sending the return. If you’ve not sent one before, you should also register for Self Assessment by <%= sa_register_deadline %>.</p>

    <h2>Your Child Benefit</h2>
    <p>You can choose to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/child-benefit-tax-charge/stop-child-benefit">stop getting Child Benefit</a> - you must pay any tax you owe</li>
      <li>carry on getting Child Benefit - for each tax year you get it you must fill in a tax return and pay any tax you owe</li>
    </ul>

    <% if @calculator.tax_year == 2012 -%>
      <p>Your result for the next tax year may be higher because the tax charge will apply to the whole tax year (and not just 7 January to 5 April 2013).</p>
