      <p>To pay the tax you must send a tax return.</p>
      <p>There are <a href="<%= internal_url "/self-assessment-tax-return-deadlines" %>">deadlines</a> for sending the return. If you’ve not sent one before, you should also register for Self Assessment by <%= sa_register_deadline %>.</p>

      <% if @calculator.tax_year == 2012 -%>
