    <h4>Your Child Benefit</h4>
    <p>You can choose to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[stop getting Child Benefit]– you must pay any tax you owe</li>
      <li>carry on getting Child Benefit – for each tax year you get it you must fill in a tax return and pay any tax you owe</li>
    </ul>

    <% if @calculator.adjusted_net_income_amount > 50099 and @calculator.tax_year == 2012 %>
      <p>Your result for the next tax year may be higher because the charge will apply to the whole tax year (and not just 7 January to 5 April 2013).</p>
