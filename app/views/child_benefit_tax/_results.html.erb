  <h4>Your options</h4>
  
  <p>Once you’ve paid any tax you owe, you must consider your options. You can either stop getting Child Benefit, or carry on getting it and fill in a tax return each year to pay back what you owe.</p>

    <p>The Child Benefit tax charge only affects Child Benefit received between 7 January and 5 April 2013 - it affects Child Benefit you’ve received for part of the 2012 to 2013 tax year. You may have to pay more back in future tax years if you choose to keep receiving it.</p>
