        <h3>How and when to pay</h3>

        <p>To pay the tax charge you must fill in a Self Assessment tax return each tax year. Follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="<%= internal_url "/register-for-self-assessment" %>">Register for Self Assessment</a> if you don’t already fill in a tax return - you should do this by <%= sa_register_deadline %>.</li>
          <li>Fill in the tax return and confirm the amount of Child Benefit received for the tax year.</li>
          <li>Send the tax return.</li>
          <li>Pay the tax you owe.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>There are <a href="<%= internal_url "/self-assessment-tax-return-deadlines" %>">deadlines</a> for sending the tax return and paying the tax.</p>

        <div class="application-notice info-notice">
          <p>The person with the highest income pays the tax charge, so use your partner’s income in the calculator if it’s higher than yours.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Your Child Benefit</h3>
        <p>You can choose to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="<%= internal_url "/child-benefit-tax-charge/stop-child-benefit" %>">stop getting Child Benefit</a> - you must pay any tax you owe</li>
          <li>carry on getting Child Benefit - for each tax year you get it you must fill in a tax return and pay any tax you owe</li>
        </ul>

        <% if @calculator.tax_year == 2012 -%>
          <p>Your result for the next tax year may be higher because the tax charge will apply to the whole tax year (and not just 7 January to 5 April 2013).</p>
